### Running command for Managers

- If a manager selects `View Products for Sale`, the app will list every available item by IDs, names, prices, and quantities.

- If a manager selects `View Low Inventory`, then it will list all items with an inventory count lower than five.

- If a manager selects `Add to Inventory`, your app should display a prompt that will let the manager "add more" of any item currently in the store.
